input to be selected based on whether a condition is true. Some basic conditions
have been provided including:
Not Empty - is true if the input is not empty.
Matches - is true if the source (converted to a string) matches a regular expression.
Comparison - is true if one source compares (==,!=,>,<,<=,>=) to another source.
And - is true if both of two underlying conditions are.
Or - is true if either of two underlying conditions are true.
Not - is true if the underlying condition is false.

with a value.
