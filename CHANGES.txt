Changes for release 0.6.6
===========================
New Features
------------
[2009-03-04] Added sesame xpath functions library. 
Example query using fn:concat follows:
PREFIX fn: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions#>
select ?name where {?s ?p ?name .
FILTER ( ?name=fn:concat('Giovanni ','Tummarello') )
}
[2009-03-03] Added link to documentation page from each operator on design page.
Clicking the link opens the documentation page on another tab. Documentation is
currently skeletal.
[2009-03-03] Added a Choose (if/then/else) operator. This allows one or another
input to be selected based on whether a condition is true. Some basic conditions
have been provided including:
Not Empty - is true if the input is not empty.
Matches - is true if the source (converted to a string) matches a regular expression.
Comparison - is true if one source compares (==,!=,>,<,<=,>=) to another source.
And - is true if both of two underlying conditions are.
Or - is true if either of two underlying conditions are true.
Not - is true if the underlying condition is false.
[2009-03-03] Added Replace Text operator, all occurrences of an pattern are replaced
with a value.
[2009-03-02] Added RDF Extract operator, which parses rdf/xml. (This will later be
modified to extract metadata using any23).
